# Portfullio

Welcome to Portfullio! This project is a web-based application where you can view and track your entire investment portfolio at once. 

Instead of using multiple apps, websites, and platforms to keep track of various financial investments such as Crypto, Stocks, and other Digital Assets, Portfullio keeps track of everything at once.

### To start the App

1) Make sure you have the latest version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

2) Enter the portfullio directory on the repository by the folllowing commands
```
cd portfullio
npm install
npm run dev
```
3) Open the link to localhost 5173.

4) On a separate terminal, enter the portfullio/backend directory by running the following commands
```
cd portfullio/backend
npm install
npm run start
```
Now the project is ready to run. Note that you will need the correct API keys in a .env file that goes in the portfullio/backend directory for the project to run correctly.
