# Portfullio

Welcome to Portfullio! This project is a web-based application where you can view and track your entire investment portfolio at once. 

Instead of using multiple apps, websites, and platforms to keep track of various financial investments such as Crypto, Stocks, and other Digital Assets, Portfullio keeps track of everything at once.

### To start the App

1) Make sure you have the latest version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

```
cd portfullio
npm run dev
```

Open the link to localhost 5173 and enjoy!
